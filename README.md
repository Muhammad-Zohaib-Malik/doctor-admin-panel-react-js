This project is designed to refine my GitHub skills, focusing on setting up and managing a professional branching workflow similar to that of an industry-level project. The primary goal is to simulate real-world scenarios by creating and maintaining a staging branch, along with other relevant branches such as development and feature branches.

Key Objectives:

Implement a multi-branch development strategy
Set up a staging branch for pre-production testing
Establish feature branches for new functionalities and improvements
Ensure smooth continuous integration and deployment workflows
This project serves as a hands-on practice to enhance version control skills and adopt industry-standard practices for future professional projects.
